### Creating the Team Agent

```python
from aixplain.factories import AgentFactory, TeamAgentFactory, ModelFactory

GPT_4O_MINI_ID = "669a63646eb56306647e1091"
web_search_tool = AgentFactory.create_model_tool(model="6736411cf127849667606689")

content_generator_agent = AgentFactory.create(
    name="Content Generator",
    description="Generates engaging social media content.",
    llm_id=GPT_4O_MINI_ID,
    tools=[web_search_tool],
)

content_reviewer_agent = AgentFactory.create(
    name="Content Reviewer",
    description="Reviews social media content and provides feedback.",
    llm_id=GPT_4O_MINI_ID,
    tools=[],
)

content_editor_agent = AgentFactory.create(
    name="Content Editor",
    description="Edits content based on feedback.",
    llm_id=GPT_4O_MINI_ID,
    tools=[web_search_tool],
)

publish_to_threads_model = ModelFactory.create_utility_model(name="Publish to Threads Trial", code=publish_to_threads)
publish_to_threads_tool = AgentFactory.create_model_tool(model=publish_to_threads_model.id)

content_publisher_agent = AgentFactory.create(
    name="Content Publisher",
    description="Publishes validated content to Threads.",
    llm_id=GPT_4O_MINI_ID,
    tools=[publish_to_threads_tool],
)

team_agent = TeamAgentFactory.create(
    name="Threads Posting Agent",
    agents=[content_generator_agent, content_reviewer_agent, content_editor_agent, content_publisher_agent],
    description="Manages end-to-end social media content creation and publishing.",
    use_mentalist_and_inspector=True,
)
```

### Running the Agent

```python
QUERY = """
Profile:
{{profile}}

Content input:
{{content_input}}

User feedback:
{{user_feedback}}
"""

profile = "Professional business coach. Be concise and focus on actionable advice."
content_input = "One unknown but effective productivity hack."
user_feedback = "None"

response = team_agent.run(query=QUERY, content={"profile": profile, "content_input": content_input, "user_feedback": user_feedback})
print(response.data['output'])
```

### Editing the Content

```python
user_feedback = "Add a step-by-step implementation and use an emoji."
edit_response = team_agent.run(query=QUERY, content={"profile": profile, "content_input": response.data["output"], "user_feedback": user_feedback})
print(edit_response.data['output'])

Publishing the Content

user_feedback = "Looks good, publish it."
publish_response = team_agent.run(query=QUERY, content={"profile": profile, "content_input": edit_response.data["output"], "user_feedback": user_feedback})
print(publish_response.data['output'])
```
